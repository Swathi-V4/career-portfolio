## Reflection

When I first started this portfolio site, my instinct was to try to get to the end result immediately. I wanted to get it done easily and though having AI help me through it all would be the best way. But I learned that this usually causes confusion or changes that don’t match what I actually want. AI can confuse my work because early on I’m still figuring out what I want and what looks good. So instead, I followed a more structured, spec-driven process.

First, I created a simple starting version of the site (a basic index.html) to make sure I could deploy something quickly. Then I focused on getting GitHub Pages working so I had a real live URL as proof that the site exists and updates correctly. After that foundation was working, I could improve the content without worrying about deployment problems.

This workflow helped me understand that AI (and even my own ideas) can drift if I don’t set clear boundaries. Having a a vison and sticking to it made it easier to stay focused: create the repo, add index.html, deploy with GitHub Pages, and then document the process in the README. The biggest thing I learned is that shipping in small steps is faster and less stressful than trying to perfect everything at once, and having a live site early makes it easier to test and improve.
