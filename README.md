## Reflection

When I first started building this portfolio site, my instinct was to jump straight to the final result. I thought using AI to generate everything at once would make the process faster and easier. However, I quickly realized that this approach created confusion. Early in the project, I was still figuring out what I wanted the site to look like and how I wanted it structured. Without clear direction, AI suggestions sometimes introduced changes that did not align with my vision. This experience taught me that tools are most effective when guided by clear boundaries.

To solve this, I shifted to a structured, spec-driven workflow. I began by defining a simple specification outlining the required sections and overall visual goals. Then I created a basic index.html file and focused on deploying it through GitHub Pages as quickly as possible. Having a live URL early gave me proof that the site worked and allowed me to test updates immediately.

After deployment, I broke the work into focused sprints: building the MVP structure, refining content, and improving visual polish. Maintaining a project_management folder helped me keep only one sprint active at a time and prevented scope drift.

The biggest lesson I learned is that shipping in small, controlled steps is more efficient and less stressful than trying to perfect everything at once. Planning first and deploying early made the development process clearer, more intentional, and more manageable.
